# Interface
- interface is not a class
- By Default Every method of Interface is "Public Abstract"
- Interface said that what are the method you need but I will not implement them..
- Interface has just method declearation, not definition.
- all the Variable inside the Interface is by Default "Final and Static"
- Its all variable and methods are byDefault Final and Static
- the variable can call easily with className. Ex-(A.name)
- once Variable and Methods are define or Initialize cannot change again
- In Implements, You just get method to define outside not Variables..



# Note
- Interface Cannot be Instanciated
- Interface donot have its own memory in the Heap

# Important Points
- Class - Class -> extends
- Class - Interface -> implements
- interface - interface -> extends


- with the reference and the obj we can call only referene and obj methods and variables..
