# Abstact-Keyword
- Abstract keyword is used to define the method, not for implement it
- we can define its code up next into the child class


# Note
- Abstract Method is just Only define into the Abstract class
- if we extends the abstract class then we must need to implement all the abstract methods of Parent Class
- we cannot create the obj of Abstract Class..
- it is not compulsary that a abstract class has a abstract methods
- But Abstract Method must be in Abstract Class
- if a child class doesnot want to implement the abstract method of its parent class then it must that the child class is also to be abstract class and then it is Inherited by another non abstract (Concrete Class) class which must need to implemet the all the remaining abstarct methods and then used to create obj...
- Abstarct Class can have normal methods also..
- we can create the obj for annonymous class by the help of abstract class to implement its abstract methods
