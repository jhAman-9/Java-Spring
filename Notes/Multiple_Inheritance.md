# multiple Inheritance 
- Multiple Inheritance Not Work In Java

# Why ???
-       C inherite from -> A , B

- But when both the class A and B have same Method like x
and we called it from C then there is a problem that which method shold be choosen and this problem is said to be "Ambiguity"

- That's why in JAVA there is no feature of Multiple Inheritance
