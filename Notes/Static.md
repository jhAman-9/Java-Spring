# Static Variable
-  The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.
- static block is used to initialized the static variable


# static Method
- Static Method is directily called with the className
- cannot directly use non static variables inside a static method, We can use by passing obj as parameter






# Note
- if instance is not created then constructor is not called as well as static block is not called 
- dont need to insiliazed The static variable every time when constructor called

- Main is starting point, if the excuating is not start then how can we create the obj of that class
so thats why we make main as static to donot depend upon obj
